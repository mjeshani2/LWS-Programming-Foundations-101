# data_types_notes.md

## Purpose
This file explains **what data types are in Python** in a simple and beginner-friendly way.  
Data types tell Python **what kind of value** a variable is holding.

---

## What is a Data Type?
A data type defines:
- What kind of data a value is
- What operations can be done on it

Every value in Python has a data type.

---

## Main Data Types You Need to Know

### 1. int (Integer)
- Whole numbers
- No decimal point

Examples of integers:
- 1
- 10
- -5
- 1000

Used when:
- Counting
- Scoring
- Indexing

---

### 2. float (Floating-point)
- Numbers with decimal points

Examples of floats:
- 3.14
- 0.5
- 99.99
- -2.7

Used when:
- Measuring
- Calculations with precision
- Prices, heights, weights

---

### 3. str (String)
- Text data
- Written inside quotes

Examples of strings:
- "Hello"
- 'Python'
- "123"

Used when:
- Names
- Messages
- Any text information

---

### 4. bool (Boolean)
- Represents truth values
- Only two possible values

Values:
- True
- False

Used when:
- Checking conditions
- Decisions
- Yes / No logic

---

## type() Function
- Used to find out the data type of a value
- Helps in debugging and learning

Returns:
- int type
- float type
- str type
- bool type

---

## Why Understanding Data Types is Important
- Prevents logical errors
- Helps Python know how to treat data
- Makes your code more readable and reliable

---

## Learning Outcome
After this file, you should:
- Know the basic Python data types
- Understand when to use each one
- Recognize why data types matter
