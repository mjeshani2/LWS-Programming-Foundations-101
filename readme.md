# LWS Programming Foundations 101

## Overview
LWS Programming Foundations 101 is a structured beginner-level series designed to build strong fundamentals in programming.  
This repository focuses on core concepts, logical thinking, and hands-on practice through code examples, small exercises, and concise notes.

The goal of this series is to create a solid foundation that supports advanced learning in areas such as Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and System Design.

## About the Author
This series is created and maintained by **Mayank Jeshani**,  
Founder of **LWS (LearnWithStriver)** and Tutor at **LWS (LearnWithStriver)**.

## What This Series Covers
- Fundamental programming concepts
- Language syntax and semantics
- Control flow and problem-solving logic
- Functions and modular programming
- Basic data structures
- Code readability and best practices
- Short concept notes for clarity and revision

## Learning Approach
Each topic is covered using:
- Clear and minimal code examples
- Small, focused exercises
